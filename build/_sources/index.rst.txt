Pikatool: A Personal Framework for Streamlined Data Science
============================================================

Overview
--------

**Pikatool** is a modular, object-oriented toolkit designed to accelerate and standardize the data science workflow. Built with a focus on reproducibility and strategic analysis, it aims to reduce repetitive setup tasks and provide a structured approach to exploratory and predictive modeling.

Whether you're building a segmentation model or running a logistic regression, Pikatool allows you to invest more time in interpreting results and communicating insights—while spending less time on boilerplate code and setup overhead.

Use Cases
---------

Pikatool is ideal for:

* Making data science projects faster, more consistent, and reproducible
* Shifting the analyst’s focus toward strategy and insight generation
* Avoiding redundant work by encapsulating common tasks into reusable components
* Creating a personal framework for approaching data science projects with an object-oriented mindset

Key Features
------------

**Clustering**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Supports **Agglomerative Clustering** for segmenting data into interpretable groups
* Includes dendrogram visualization tools to aid communication of results to non-technical stakeholders
* Common use case: customer or respondent segmentation in survey research

**Dimensionality Reduction**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implements **Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)** to reduce dimensionality in categorical datasets
* Especially useful in preprocessing survey data before clustering or regression analysis

**Regression Analysis**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Provides wrappers and helper functions for regression tasks using `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`
* Currently supports:

  - **Logistic Regression**: Understand how various features influence the probability of a binary outcome
    + Typical use case: identifying drivers of brand consideration or reputation across different segments

Planned Extensions
------------------

Future iterations will expand modeling capabilities, enhance visualization tools, and introduce integrations with modern data workflows (e.g., pandas pipelines, MLFlow tracking).
